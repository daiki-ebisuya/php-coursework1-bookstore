# Nonrepudiation in Digital Systems

1.Nonrepudiation is a security concept that ensures a person cannot deny an action they performed in a digital system.
It provides reliable proof that a specific user carried out a specific operation, such as sending a message or making a transaction. In practical terms, it prevents someone from claiming like “I didn’t do that,” 
when the system has clear evidence that they did.
    This idea is important because most online interactions happen without direct human contact, so systems need a way to verify actions with confidence and record.

2.For an online bookstore, nonrepudiation matters especially when handling orders and payments.
    Customers need to trust that their transactions are recorded correctly,
    and the store must be able to confirm who placed an order and when. Without nonrepudiation,
    a buyer could dispute a purchase or claim that a payment was made by mistake,
    which would create problems for both sides.
    Strong nonrepudiation helps maintain fairness, reduces fraud, and protects the integrity of transaction records.

3.Logging is one method to support nonrepudiation, but there are other useful technologies as well.
    Digital signatures can verify a user’s identity through cryptographic keys.
    Audit trails track important actions step by step.
    Hash functions can show whether data has been changed.
    Some systems even use blockchain to store records in a tamper-resistant way.
    By combining these tools, digital services can improve trust and strengthen overall security.
